Design Errors/Warnings
----------------------

WARNING - map: The clock port [ce] is assigned to a non clock dedicated pin
     [36], which might affect the clock performance. Use dedicated clock
     resources for the port.
WARNING - map: The clock port [sck] is assigned to a non clock dedicated pin
     [28], which might affect the clock performance. Use dedicated clock
     resources for the port.
